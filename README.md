## Hi, I'm Alex

**I help companies build and improve their manual and automated testing practices.** I have over a decade of professional experience in Quality Assurance performing manual testing, leading testing teams, and building test automation frameworks and end-to-end tests. I am 100% focused on software engineering and driving software quality through test automation using the latest technologies. I'm also having a lot of fun with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), learning about static-site generators, and all that cool Jamstack stuff.

- 📫 How to reach me: alexpeterhall @ gmail
- 🛠 I'm currently working on test automation with [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), and TypeScript.
- 🚀 I'm learning Python, React, and focusing on computer science fundamentals.
- 🏍 Fun facts: I play classical violin, ride motorcycles, and love watches.
